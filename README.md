This is a tool to explore the SC Salary database provided through the state's accountability portal: https://www.admin.sc.gov/accountability-portal/state-salaries

Files from 2015 - July 2019 were pulled from Archive.org's copy of the site. There are some points in which the CSV file links appear to have been broken and so some files may be missing.

In the future this project will have a tool to extract the files from the web site when they change to help ensure ongoing updates of new data.

As this is SC State government provided data it is in the public domain.
